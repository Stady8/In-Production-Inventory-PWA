# Inventory-Website(In Testing)
**About** 
<br>
<br>
This program allows for a multitude of things. One of them being able to track inventory items including information about the item and their location of different apparatuses. Inventory can be labeled with QR codes and scanned which allows users to quickly find information about the item and itsâ€™ location. It also allows for the tracking of events such as training and incidents. If an item is needed in a training session, or at an incident, it can be scanned with the QR code and linked to that specific event. This creates an inventory usage log and allows for tracking of members' attendance as well as what items are lended to members. Another notable functionality of the app is the ability to create a checklist for different apparatuses and inventory items. Members are then able to complete the monthly checklist and send email alerts to specific individuals when something needs to be repaired.
